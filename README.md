Django User Authentication and Authorization system Implementation 

# What Is Django Authentication?
<p> Django is a free, open-source Python web framework that supports fast development and clean, functional design. It provides a ready-made infrastructure for Python web applications, allowing developers to focus on building application logic. </p>
<br>
<p> Django provides a robust user authentication system, with support for user accounts, user groups, permissions, and cookie-based user session processing.
Although it is called “Django authentication”, the Django authentication system has a broader scope and handles both authentication (ensuring users are who they say they are) and authorization (determining what a user can do in the system, once they are authenticated). </p>
<br>
<p> Django’s authentication system is very generic, by design, and does not provide many specific features commonly found in web authentication systems. You can add many of these specific features using third-party packages.</p>
